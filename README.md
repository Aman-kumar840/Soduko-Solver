# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver using recursion and backtracking algorithms. The solver is capable of solving Sudoku puzzles of size 9x9.

## Description

The Sudoku solver uses a recursive approach combined with backtracking to find the solution for the given Sudoku grid. It systematically tries different numbers from 1 to 9 and checks if each number placement is safe according to the Sudoku rules. If a number placement is safe, it continues solving the remaining grid recursively. If the assigned number leads to an incorrect solution, it backtracks and tries a different number.

## Usage

To use the Sudoku solver:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler compatible with your system.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Enter the Sudoku grid (9x9) through the console input. Use '0' to represent empty cells.
5. The solver will attempt to find a solution for the Sudoku grid.
6. If a solution is found, it will be displayed in the console output.
7. If no solution exists, a corresponding message will be displayed.

## Requirements

To compile and run the Sudoku solver, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
